	  	Never lose track of your tools, games or supplies ever again from BorrowBrigade! BorrowBrigade is a system to take control of what's yours. BorrowBrigade uses a database backend where you control what goes in and what goes out. You get to determine who borrows what, when, and for how long.

  <q>I no longer need to go all the way to the store to pick up something that I'll only use once. BorrowBrigade has streamlined efficiencies and is great for my business too. My church also uses BorrowBrigade, and ever since we have started using BorrowBrigade, we haven't lost a single item! BorrowBrigade is so easy to use, is very user-friendly, and has almost no learning curve - we are able to get right in and start borrowing!</q>

  <q>My company actually uses BorrowBrigade in a special way. We are able to use their technology to streamline our process of renting out homes faster and easier. BorrowBrigade reduces our process time, so that owners get their money faster, and users are able to gain access to their rentals faster too. BorrowBrigade's technology and system is state-of-the-art material, and I'm thankful to have found such a smart company as this one.</q>
